# IoT-Based Smart Agriculture Monitoring System
📌 Project Overview
This project is an IoT-based Smart Agriculture Monitoring System using ESP32, Soil Moisture Sensor, and DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Sensor.
The collected data is sent to the Blynk IoT Cloud for real-time monitoring.

👉 With this project, farmers can remotely monitor:
🌡️ Temperature
💧 Humidity
🌱 Soil Moisture

🛠️ Components Required
ESP32 Development Board
DHT22 Sensor (Temperature & Humidity)
Soil Moisture Sensor
Jumper Wires + Breadboard

🔌 Circuit Diagram
⚡ Pin Connections
Soil Moisture Sensor:

VCC → 3.3V (ESP32)

GND → GND (ESP32)

AO (Analog Out) → GPIO 34 (ESP32)

DHT22 Sensor:
VCC → 3.3V (ESP32)
GND → GND (ESP32)
Data → GPIO 4 (ESP32)

📲 Blynk App Dashboard
V1 → Soil Moisture (%)
V2 → Temperature (°C)
V3 → Humidity (%)
